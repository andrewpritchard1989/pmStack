## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/pmstack/bin/pmstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/pmstack/bin/pmstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.pmstack/sessions
touch ~/.pmstack/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.pmstack/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.pmstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_PROACTIVE=$(~/.claude/skills/pmstack/bin/pmstack-config get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
_PROTOTYPE_TOOL=$(~/.claude/skills/pmstack/bin/pmstack-config get prototype_tool 2>/dev/null || echo "figma-make")
echo "PROTOTYPE_TOOL: $_PROTOTYPE_TOOL"
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p ~/.pmstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"setup-browser-cookies","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.pmstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest PMStack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /office-hours, /cpo-review). If you would have auto-invoked a skill,
briefly say: "I think /skill-name might help here — want me to run it?" and wait.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: tell the user "PMStack v{new} is available (you have v{old}). Run `cd ~/.claude/skills/pmstack && git pull && ./setup` to upgrade." If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running PMStack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, challenging. Sound like a great product leader, not a consultant. Name the problem, the user, the evidence. No filler, no hedging.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do next.

The PM always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the PM decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the PM should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard" or "I'm not confident in this result."

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the event:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
# Local analytics (always, no binary needed)
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.pmstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort. If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown".

# Setup Browser Cookies

Import logged-in sessions from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session.

## CDP mode check

First, check if browse is already connected to the user's real browser:
```bash
$B status 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Mode: cdp" && echo "CDP_MODE=true" || echo "CDP_MODE=false"
```
If `CDP_MODE=true`: tell the user "Not needed — you're connected to your real browser via CDP. Your cookies and sessions are already available." and stop. No cookie import needed.

## How it works

1. Find the browse binary
2. Run `cookie-import-browser` to detect installed browsers and open the picker UI
3. User selects which cookie domains to import in their browser
4. Cookies are decrypted and loaded into the Playwright session

## Steps

### 1. Find the browse binary

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/pmstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/pmstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.claude/skills/pmstack/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "PMStack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | BUN_VERSION=1.3.10 bash
   fi
   ```

### 2. Open the cookie picker

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser
```

This auto-detects installed Chromium browsers and opens
an interactive picker UI in your default browser where you can:
- Switch between installed browsers
- Search domains
- Click "+" to import a domain's cookies
- Click trash to remove imported cookies

Tell the user: **"Cookie picker opened — select the domains you want to import in your browser, then tell me when you're done."**

### 3. Direct import (alternative)

If the user specifies a domain directly (e.g., `/setup-browser-cookies github.com`), skip the UI:

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain github.com
```

Replace `comet` with the appropriate browser if specified.

### 4. Verify

After the user confirms they're done:

```bash
$B cookies
```

Show the user a summary of imported cookies (domain counts).

## Notes

- On macOS, the first import per browser may trigger a Keychain dialog — click "Allow" / "Always Allow"
- On Linux, `v11` cookies may require `secret-tool`/libsecret access; `v10` cookies use Chromium's standard fallback key
- Cookie picker is served on the same port as the browse server (no extra process)
- Only domain names and cookie counts are shown in the UI — no cookie values are exposed
- The browse session persists cookies between commands, so imported cookies work immediately
